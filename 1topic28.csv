 [1] "TRADITIONALLY, STATE-SPACE MODELS ARE FITTED TO DATA WHERE THERE IS UNCERTAINTY IN THE OBSERVATION OR MEASUREMENT OF THE SYSTEM. STATE-SPACE MODELS ARE PARTITIONED INTO AN UNDERLYING SYSTEM PROCESS DESCRIBING THE TRANSITIONS OF THE TRUE STATES OF THE SYSTEM OVER TIME AND THE OBSERVATION PROCESS LINKING THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE SYSTEM TO THE TRUE STATES. OPEN POPULATION CAPTURE-RECAPTURE-RECOVERY DATA CAN BE MODELLED IN THIS FRAMEWORK BY REGARDING THE SYSTEM PROCESS AS THE STATE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL OBSERVED WITHIN THE STUDY IN TERMS OF BEING ALIVE OR DEAD, AND THE OBSERVATION PROCESS THE RECAPTURE AND/OR RECOVERY PROCESS. THE TRADITIONAL OBSERVATION ERROR OF A STATE-SPACE MODEL IS INCORPORATED VIA THE RECAPTURE/RECOVERY PROBABILITIES BEING LESS THAN UNITY. THE MODELS CAN BE FITTED USING A BAYESIAN DATA AUGMENTATION APPROACH AND IN STANDARD BUGS PACKAGES. APPLYING THIS STATE-SPACE FRAMEWORK TO SUCH DATA PERMITS ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITIES INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL HETEROGENEITY TO BE FITTED TO THE DATA AT VERY LITTLE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMING EFFORT. WE CONSIDER THE EFFICIENCY OF THE STATE-SPACE MODEL FITTING APPROACH BY CONSIDERING A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL FOR CAPTURE-RECAPTURE DATA RELATING TO DIPPERS AND COMPARE DIFFERENT BAYESIAN MODEL-FITTING ALGORITHMS WITHIN WINBUGS."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 [2] "INTEGRATING DEAD RECOVERIES INTO CAPTURE-RECAPTURE MODELS CAN IMPROVE INFERENCE ON DEMOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS. BUT DEAD-RECOVERY DATA DO NOT ONLY INFORM ON INDIVIDUAL FATES; THEY ALSO CONTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT INDIVIDUAL LOCATIONS. OPEN-POPULATION SPATIAL CAPTURE-RECAPTURE (OPSCR) HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FULLY EXPLOIT SUCH DATA. HERE, WE PRESENT AN OPEN-POPULATION SPATIAL CAPTURE-RECAPTURE-RECOVERY MODEL INTEGRATING THE SPATIAL INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH DEAD RECOVERIES. USING SIMULATIONS, WE INVESTIGATE THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THIS EXTENSION OF THE OPSCR MODEL IMPROVES INFERENCE AND ILLUSTRATE THE APPROACH WITH THE ANALYSIS OF A WOLVERINE (GULO GULO) DATASET FROM NORWAY. SIMULATION RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE INTEGRATION OF DEAD RECOVERIES INTO OPSCR BOOSTED THE PRECISION OF ALL DEMOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS. IN ADDITION, THE INTEGRATION OF DEAD-RECOVERY LOCATIONS BOOSTED THE PRECISION OF THE INTER-ANNUAL MOVEMENT PARAMETER, WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE IN OPSCR, BY UP TO 40% IN CASE OF SPARSE DATA. WE ALSO DETECTED A 139-367% INCREASE IN THE PROBABILITY OF MODELS REACHING CONVERGENCE WITH INCREASING PROPORTION OF DEAD RECOVERIES WHEN DEAD-RECOVERY INFORMATION WAS INTEGRATED SPATIALLY, COMPARED WITH A 30-107% INCREASE WHEN INTEGRATING DEAD RECOVERIES IN A NON-SPATIAL WAY. THE ANALYSIS OF THE WOLVERINE DATA SHOWED THE SAME GENERAL PATTERN OF IMPROVED PARAMETER PRECISION. OVERALL, OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT HOW LEVERAGING THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND SPATIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN DEAD-RECOVERY DATA IN A SPATIAL CAPTURE-RECAPTURE FRAMEWORK CAN IMPROVE POPULATION PARAMETER ESTIMATION."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 [3] "DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF MULTISTATE MARK-RECAPTURE MODELS, WHICH PROVIDE ESTIMATES OF PARAMETERS OF MARKOV PROCESSES IN THE FACE OF IMPERFECT DETECTION, HAVE BECOME COMMON OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS. RECENTLY, ESTIMATING PARAMETERS OF HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS, WHERE THE STATE OF AN INDIVIDUAL CAN BE UNCERTAIN EVEN WHEN IT IS DETECTED, HAS RECEIVED ATTENTION. PREVIOUS WORK HAS SHOWN THAT IGNORING STATE UNCERTAINTY BIASES ESTIMATES OF SURVIVAL AND STATE TRANSITION PROBABILITIES, THEREBY REDUCING THE POWER TO DETECT EFFECTS. EFFORTS TO ADJUST FOR STATE UNCERTAINTY HAVE INCLUDED SPECIAL CASES AND A GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR A SINGLE SAMPLE PER PERIOD OF INTEREST. WE PROVIDE A FLEXIBLE FRAMEWORK FOR ADJUSTING FOR STATE UNCERTAINTY IN MULTISTATE MODELS, WHILE UTILIZING MULTIPLE SAMPLING OCCASIONS PER PERIOD OF INTEREST TO INCREASE PRECISION AND REMOVE PARAMETER REDUNDANCY. THESE MODELS ALSO PRODUCE DIRECT ESTIMATES OF STATE STRUCTURE FOR EACH PRIMARY PERIOD, EVEN FOR THE CASE WHERE THERE IS JUST ONE SAMPLING OCCASION. WE APPLY OUR MODEL TO EXPECTED-VALUE DATA, AND TO DATA FROM A STUDY OF FLORIDA MANATEES, TO PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF THE IMPROVEMENT IN PRECISION DUE TO SECONDARY CAPTURE OCCASIONS. WE HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED THESE MODELS IN PROGRAM MARK. THIS GENERAL FRAMEWORK COULD ALSO BE USED BY PRACTITIONERS TO CONSIDER CONSTRAINED MODELS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST, OR TO MODEL THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WITHIN-PRIMARY-PERIOD PARAMETERS (E. G., STATE STRUCTURE) AND BETWEEN-PRIMARY-PERIOD PARAMETERS (E.G., STATE TRANSITION PROBABILITIES)."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 [4] "CAPTURE-RECAPTURE MODELS WERE ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED TO ACCOUNT FOR ENCOUNTER PROBABILITIES THAT ARE LESS THAN 1 IN FREE-RANGING ANIMAL POPULATIONS. NOWADAYS, THESE MODELS CAN DEAL WITH THE MOVEMENT OF ANIMALS BETWEEN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND ARE ALSO USED TO STUDY TRANSITIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT STATES. HOWEVER, THEIR USE TO ESTIMATE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN STATES DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR UNCERTAINTY IN STATE ASSIGNMENT. I PRESENT THE EXTENSION OF MULTIEVENT MODELS, WHICH DOES INCORPORATE THIS UNCERTAINTY. MULTIEVENT MODELS BELONG TO THE FAMILY OF HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS. I ALSO SHOW IN THIS ARTICLE THAT THE MEMORY MODEL, IN WHICH THE NEXT STATE OR LOCATION IS INFLUENCED BY THE PREVIOUS STATE OCCUPIED, CAN BE FULLY TREATED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF MULTIEVENT MODELS."

 [6] "WE CONSIDER THE ISSUE OF ANALYZING COMPLEX ECOLOGICAL DATA IN THE PRESENCE OF COVARIATE INFORMATION AND MODEL UNCERTAINTY. SEVERAL ISSUES CAN ARISE WHEN ANALYZING SUCH DATA, NOT LEAST THE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHERE THERE ARE MISSING COVARIATE VALUES. THIS IS MOST ACUTELY OBSERVED IN THE PRESENCE OF TIME-VARYING COVARIATES. WE CONSIDER MARK-RECAPTURE-RECOVERY DATA, WHERE THE CORRESPONDING RECAPTURE PROBABILITIES ARE LESS THAN UNITY, SO THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT ALWAYS OBSERVED AT EACH CAPTURE EVENT. THIS OFTEN LEADS TO A LARGE AMOUNT OF MISSING TIME-VARYING INDIVIDUAL COVARIATE INFORMATION, BECAUSE THE COVARIATE CANNOT USUALLY BE RECORDED IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS NOT OBSERVED. IN ADDITION, WE ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF MODEL SELECTION OVER THESE COVARIATES WITH MISSING DATA. WE CONSIDER A BAYESIAN APPROACH, WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO DEAL WITH LARGE AMOUNTS OF MISSING DATA, BY ESSENTIALLY TREATING THE MISSING VALUES AS AUXILIARY VARIABLES. THIS APPROACH ALSO ALLOWS A QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT MODELS VIA POSTERIOR MODEL PROBABILITIES, OBTAINED VIA THE REVERSIBLE JUMP MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO ALGORITHM. TO DEMONSTRATE THIS APPROACH WE ANALYZE DATA RELATING TO SOAY SHEEP, WHICH POSE SEVERAL STATISTICAL CHALLENGES IN FULLY DESCRIBING THE INTRICACIES OF THE SYSTEM."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 [7] "STATE-SPACE MODELS ARE AN INCREASINGLY COMMON AND IMPORTANT TOOL IN THE QUANTITATIVE ECOLOGISTS' ARMOURY, PARTICULARLY FOR THE ANALYSIS OF TIME-SERIES DATA. THIS IS DUE TO BOTH THEIR FLEXIBILITY AND INTUITIVE STRUCTURE, DESCRIBING THE DIFFERENT INDIVIDUAL PROCESSES OF A COMPLEX SYSTEM, THUS SIMPLIFYING THE MODEL SPECIFICATION STEP. STATE-SPACE MODELS ARE COMPOSED OF TWO PROCESSES (A) THE SYSTEM (OR STATE) PROCESS THAT DESCRIBES THE DYNAMICS OF THE TRUE UNDERLYING STATE OF THE SYSTEM OVER TIME; AND (B) THE OBSERVATION PROCESS THAT LINKS THE OBSERVED DATA WITH THE CURRENT TRUE STATE OF THE SYSTEM AT THAT TIME. SPECIFICATION OF THE GENERAL MODEL STRUCTURE CONSISTS OF CONSIDERING EACH DISTINCT ECOLOGICAL PROCESS WITHIN THE SYSTEM AND OBSERVATION PROCESSES, WHICH ARE THEN AUTOMATICALLY COMBINED WITHIN THE STATE-SPACE STRUCTURE. THERE IS TYPICALLY A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE MODEL AND THE ASSOCIATED MODEL-FITTING PROCESS. SIMPLER MODEL SPECIFICATIONS PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF SIMPLER MODEL-FITTING TOOLS; WHEREAS MORE COMPLEX MODEL SPECIFICATIONS, WITH NONLINEAR DYNAMICS AND/OR NON-GAUSSIAN STOCHASTICITY OFTEN REQUIRE MORE SOPHISTICATED MODEL-FITTING ALGORITHMS TO BE APPLIED. WE PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF GENERAL STATE-SPACE MODELS BEFORE FOCUSING ON THE DIFFERENT MODEL-FITTING TOOLS AVAILABLE.

 [8] "DISCRETE STATE-SPACE MODELS ARE USED IN ECOLOGY TO DESCRIBE THE DYNAMICS OF WILD ANIMAL POPULATIONS, WITH PARAMETERS, SUCH AS THE PROBABILITY OF SURVIVAL, BEING OF ECOLOGICAL INTEREST. FOR A PARTICULAR PARAMETRIZATION OF A MODEL IT IS NOT ALWAYS CLEAR WHICH PARAMETERS CAN BE ESTIMATED. THIS INABILITY TO ESTIMATE ALL PARAMETERS IS KNOWN AS PARAMETER REDUNDANCY OR A MODEL IS DESCRIBED AS NONIDENTIFIABLE. IN THIS PAPER WE DEVELOP METHODS THAT CAN BE USED TO DETECT PARAMETER REDUNDANCY IN DISCRETE STATE-SPACE MODELS. AN EXHAUSTIVE SUMMARY IS A COMBINATION OF PARAMETERS THAT FULLY SPECIFY A MODEL. TO USE GENERAL METHODS FOR DETECTING PARAMETER REDUNDANCY A SUITABLE EXHAUSTIVE SUMMARY IS REQUIRED. THIS PAPER PROPOSES TWO METHODS FOR THE DERIVATION OF AN EXHAUSTIVE SUMMARY FOR DISCRETE STATE-SPACE MODELS USING DISCRETE ANALOGUES OF METHODS FOR CONTINUOUS STATE-SPACE MODELS. WE ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT COMBINING MULTIPLE DATA SETS, THROUGH THE USE OF AN INTEGRATED POPULATION MODEL, MAY RESULT IN A MODEL IN WHICH ALL PARAMETERS ARE ESTIMABLE, EVEN THOUGH MODELS FITTED TO THE SEPARATE DATA SETS MAY BE PARAMETER REDUNDANT."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 [9] "ESTIMATING DEMOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS OF INTEREST IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF APPLIED CONSERVATION BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY, WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC MODELS AND DEMOGRAPHIC DATA HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. THESE ADVANCES HAVE BEEN SPURRED BY THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF INFORMATION THEORETIC APPROACHES, PROGRAMS SUCH AS MARK AND SURGE, AND BAYESIAN INFERENCE. THE USE OF BAYESIAN ANALYSES HAS ALSO BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR, WHERE WINBUGS, JAGS, STAN, AND NIMBLE PROVIDE INCREASED USER FLEXIBILITY. DESPITE RECENT ADVANCES IN BAYESIAN DEMOGRAPHIC MODELING, SOME CAPTURE-RECAPTURE MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN PROGRAM MARK REMAIN UNAVAILABLE TO QUANTITATIVE ECOLOGISTS THAT WISH TO USE BAYESIAN MODELING APPROACHES. WE PROVIDE NOVEL PARAMETERIZATIONS OF CAPTURE-MARK-RECAPTURE-RESIGHT-RECOVERY MODELS IMPLEMENTED IN PROGRAM MARK THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN THE BUGS LANGUAGE. SIMULATIONS SHOW THAT THE MODELS DESCRIBED HEREIN PROVIDE ACCURATE PARAMETER ESTIMATES. OUR PARAMETERIZATIONS OF THESE MODELS CAN EASILY BE EXTENDED TO ESTIMATE ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS ENTRY PROBABILITY, ADDITIONAL LIVE STATES, OR CAUSE-SPECIFIC MORTALITY RATES. ADDITIONALLY, IMPLEMENTING THESE MODELS IN A BAYESIAN FRAMEWORK ALLOWS USERS TO READILY ESTIMATE PARAMETERS AS MIXTURES, INCORPORATE RANDOM INDIVIDUAL OR TEMPORAL VARIATION, AND USE INFORMATIVE PRIORS TO ASSIST WITH PARAMETER ESTIMATION."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
[10] "WE CONSIDER MULTI-STATE CAPTURE-RECAPTURE-RECOVERY DATA WHERE OBSERVED INDIVIDUALS ARE RECORDED IN A SET OF POSSIBLE DISCRETE STATES. TRADITIONALLY, THE ARNASON-SCHWARZ MODEL HAS BEEN FITTED TO SUCH DATA WHERE THE STATE PROCESS IS MODELED AS A FIRST-ORDER MARKOV CHAIN, THOUGH SECOND-ORDER MODELS HAVE ALSO BEEN PROPOSED AND FITTED TO DATA. HOWEVER, LOW-ORDER MARKOV MODELS MAY NOT ACCURATELY REPRESENT THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGY. FOR EXAMPLE, SPECIFYING A (TIME-INDEPENDENT) FIRST-ORDER MARKOV PROCESS INVOLVES THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE DWELL TIME IN EACH STATE (I.E., THE DURATION OF A STAY IN A GIVEN STATE) HAS A GEOMETRIC DISTRIBUTION, AND HENCE THAT THE MODAL DWELL TIME IS ONE. SPECIFYING TIME-DEPENDENT OR HIGHER-ORDER PROCESSES PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY, BUT AT THE EXPENSE OF A POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL MODEL PARAMETERS. WE EXTEND THE ARNASON-SCHWARZ MODEL BY SPECIFYING A SEMI-MARKOV MODEL FOR THE STATE PROCESS, WHERE THE DWELL-TIME DISTRIBUTION IS SPECIFIED MORE GENERALLY, USING, FOR EXAMPLE, A SHIFTED POISSON OR NEGATIVE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION. A STATE EXPANSION TECHNIQUE IS APPLIED IN ORDER TO REPRESENT THE RESULTING SEMI-MARKOV ARNASON-SCHWARZ MODEL IN TERMS OF A SIMPLER AND COMPUTATIONALLY TRACTABLE HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL. SEMI-MARKOV ARNASON-SCHWARZ MODELS COME WITH ONLY A VERY MODEST INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PARAMETERS, YET PERMIT A SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FLEXIBLE STATE PROCESS. MODEL SELECTION CAN BE PERFORMED USING STANDARD PROCEDURES, AND IN PARTICULAR VIA THE USE OF INFORMATION CRITERIA. THE SEMI-MARKOV APPROACH ALLOWS FOR IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL INFERENCE TO BE DRAWN ON THE UNDERLYING STATE PROCESS, FOR EXAMPLE, ON THE TIMES SPENT IN THE DIFFERENT STATES. THE FEASIBILITY OF THE APPROACH IS DEMONSTRATED IN A SIMULATION STUDY, BEFORE BEING APPLIED TO REAL DATA CORRESPONDING TO HOUSE FINCHES WHERE THE STATES CORRESPOND TO THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF CONJUNCTIVITIS."
